/*C++ features that are easy

<iostream> 
cout << "message";
cin >> x;

inline - for optimization

for expressions allows local declarations

    for( int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
    {
        ...
    }

    you can put declarations anywhere
    : code
    double area;
    area = h *w;
    cout << "Area is : ";

    inferred typing with
    * auto

    auto i = 3;
    auto x = 3.0; //duck typing
    // very useful when types get very complicated.
    // for simple types keep normal type declarations

    STL = Standard Template Library
* It add many containers (lists, stacks occur here)
* very efficient algorithms for use

vector is a powerful and flexible kind of an array, can be indexed

vector <int> a (N);
