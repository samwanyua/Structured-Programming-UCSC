/*Enums as an ADT*/

/*
* ADT is User Defined Types
* Enum is Enumaration
*useful for different data but not all data
eg. Days of the week

*Type safe languages make debugging easier.

example
    enum day { sun, mon, tue, wed, thur, fri, sat};
    enum day today = fri;

    sun == 0 this is a default initialization of enumarators
    mon == 1 this is a default initialization of enumarators

    enum is a form of int type
